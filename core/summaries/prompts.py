    1. Banned Words:
        - Dazzling
        - Countless → be more precise
        - Endless → be more precise
        - Ooze
        - Truly
        - Great → be more precise or omit, likely unnecessary
        - Jaw-dropping → unnecessary; describe what the views are (“views of the Imperial Palace” not “jaw-dropping views of the Imperial Palace”)
        - Stunning → unnecessary; describe what the views are (“views of the Imperial Palace” not “stunning views of the Imperial Palace”)
        - Wow (as a verb, like “this hotel wows with its views...”)
        - Tasty
        - Breathtaking
        - Stunning
        - Good (as in, “good breakfast”—not precise enough!)


    2. Phrasing
        - “X hotel offers…”
            Instead, we should just state the facts. A hotel can’t “offer” stuff
            Example: “The hotel offers beautiful pools, great beach access, lively nightlife, and friendly staff, with many enjoying the dining options and fun atmosphere.”
            Make more active, direct, and human: “The hotel has beautiful pools, beach access, lively nightlife, and friendly staff. Many enjoy the range of dining options and fun atmosphere in particular.”
                Avoid gerund forms of verbs
        - Don’t need to restate the hotel name
        - Complete vs. incomplete sentences: o3 does not necessarily write in complete sentences, which is totally okay! However, some sentences were a weird hybrid of the two. It’s better and clearer to pick one and run with it.
            Example: Arrival is awkward because the hotel sits in a pedestrian zone with no parking, drop-offs two streets away and festival noise in June.
            Better: Arrival is awkward because the hotel sits in a pedestrian zone with no parking, so you’ll be dropped off two streets away. Also, expect festival noise in June.
        - Unclear sentence structure
            Example: Historic Alfama spot is walkable to river, sights, buses and trains, yet the pedestrian lane, no parking and June festivals hinder drop-offs and quiet
            Better: The hotel, in historic Alfama, is walkable to the river, sights, buses and trains. However, the pedestrian lane and limited parking hinder drop-offs, while June festivals can get noisy.
            Example: Minor gripes cover street noise, small showers or rooms, occasional billing or housekeeping slips, key drop-off hassle and the rooftop sometimes closed
            Better: Minor gripes cover street noise, small showers or rooms, occasional billing or housekeeping slips, key drop-off hassle, and unexpected rooftop closures.
        - Be simple and concise
            Instead of phrases like, “rooms deliver breathtaking views of the skyline,” we can just say, “rooms have views of the skyline,” or “rooms come with skyline views”
        - “With” clauses
            Example: Service impresses, with swift kiosk check-in, frequent upgrades, and attentive concierge and housekeeping teams.
            Better: Guests love the swift kiosk check-in, frequent upgrades, and attentive concierge and housekeeping teams.

    3. Grammar
        - Use Oxford Commas
        - Em dash: use dashes without spaces
        - ONLY use American Spelling. NEVER use British Spelling or any other spellings other than American Spelling
        - Kids’ club, not kids club
        - On site is two words, except if it’s used as an adjective, as in “on-site bar”

SUMMARY_EXAMPLES = '''
    Summary 1:
        Service is highly attentive and friendly, with seamless help from staff and concierge.
        Rooms are spacious, modern, and come with views of the Imperial Palace, Mt. Fuji, and the city.
        Guests highlight the breakfast buffet with Japanese and Western options, the spa, pool, gym, and the popular bars, including Virtu.
        Location is quiet and directly connected to Otemachi Station, but Pigneto restaurant service can feel rushed at times.

    Summary 2:
        Pools, beach, and nightlife are highlights, along with a casino and several dining options, including sushi and a popular beach club.
        Staff are friendly overall, though some guests reported slow service, billing errors, and poor follow-up on room issues.
        Rooms range from somewhat dated or dark to updated villas with ocean or pool views, but noise and occasional maintenance problems are common.
        The resort is lively and well-kept, but families with young kids often find the atmosphere and amenities less suitable.

    Summary 3:
        Centrally located and walkable to key sites, with many restaurants and bars nearby, including a rooftop bar and a Mexican terrace spot.
        Rooms are clean, stylish, air conditioned, and may have rainfall showers, but some are small or lack full closets, and a few guests noted bulky keys, occasional shower flooding, and minor billing errors.
        Staff is consistently friendly and helpful, often arranging taxis, giving recommendations, and providing upgrades or welcome treats.
        Breakfast and the restaurant get high marks, though breakfast is not always included and the restaurant’s modern cuisine isn’t for everyone; occasional street noise can affect rooms.

    Summary 4:
        The resort is huge, clean, and has a water park, many pools, and a range of restaurants and activities for all ages.
        Food, drinks, and activities are expensive, and guests often face crowds, slow or inconsistent service, and problems reserving dinner or pool chairs, especially during peak times.
        Rooms are comfortable and well-kept, but some families find them small, and getting late check-ins, cribs, or connecting rooms can take extra time.
        Despite these issues, most guests enjoy the variety of amenities and the overall experience, especially for family trips.

    Summary 5:
        Rooms are spacious, modern, and very clean, with features like smart controls and impressive views.
        Service is friendly and proactive, with seamless upgrades and helpful staff, especially for special requests like gluten-free dining.
        Dining and amenities get high marks, including standout restaurants like Jardin and Mizumi, excellent spa and pool facilities, and easy access to both lively and quiet spaces.
        Occasional complaints mention early pool closures, lack of in-room coffee machines or fridges, and some confusion with breakfast credits, but most experiences are very positive.

    Summary 6:
        Central Alfama location near the river, trams, buses, and trains makes sightseeing easy, but the pedestrian street means no parking, drop-offs two blocks away, and June festival noise.
        Warm staff offer local tips, pack early breakfasts, leave treats, and keep rooms spotless.
        Rooms are stylish and quiet yet compact; some overlook the river while others lack daylight, storage, or twin beds, and hiccups include faulty phones or missing washcloths.
        Breakfast comes from a café shared with non-guests, a small lobby restaurant handles other meals, and limited space plus no child amenities suit the hotel to couples or solo travelers.

    Summary 7:
        Rooms are clean, comfortable, and sometimes upgraded to terraces or Hollywood-sign views.
        Staff is friendly, attentive, and hands out welcome drinks, birthday add-ons, and breakfast credits.
        The rooftop pool, restaurant, and bar draw crowds, but music can rattle upper rooms past 2 a.m.
        Multiple dining options and a walkable Hollywood location suit both leisure and business guests, yet parking runs $60 nightly and breakfast credit rules confuse some.

    Summary 8:
        Spacious, clean rooms and suites—many with terraces facing the Bellagio fountains—stand out.
        Guests praise the three pools, gym, spa, lively casino, and wide dining lineup that ranges from Scarpetta and Wicked Spoon to speakeasies like Ghost Donkey.
        Staff frequently deliver upgrades, credits, and VIP or early check-in, though some visitors face long lines, delayed rooms, credit or billing mix-ups, and a slight service dip since the MGM takeover.
        The central Strip location and energetic atmosphere keep most planning a return.
