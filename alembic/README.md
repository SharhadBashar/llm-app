- `versions`<br>
The versions/ folder contains all your migration files, named with a revision ID prefix<br>
These contain all the changes to the db, including the new model changes<br>
Each migration has upgrade() and downgrade() functions that define how to apply and revert changes<br>

- `alembic.ini`
Main configuration file that tells it how to connect to your database and where to find migration scripts.<br>
It primarily contains the database connection URL, the path to your migration files, logging settings to control output verbosity, and optional formatting rules for generated migration filenames.

- `env.py`<br>
Configures how Alembic runs migrations by setting up the database connection and linking your SQLAlchemy models' metadata.<br>
It contains two main functions - `run_migrations_offline()` for generating SQL scripts without a database connection, and `run_migrations_online()` for directly executing migrations against a live database, with the script automatically choosing which mode to use based on the context.

- `script.py.mako`
Template for new migrations

## Process
### Upgrade
1. Create a new model
2. Add it to `core/__init__.py`
3. Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m 'fixed migration description'` to create a new file in `versions` folder
4. Double check to make sure all the columns are correct, as well as verify the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions
5. Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply new migration

### Downgrade
ðŸš¨ First check the downgrade function in versions file to make sure any Enums or types that were created are also dropped ðŸš¨
1. Run `alembic downgrade -1`
2. Delete latest file in versions
3. Make changes to model
4. Run steps 3 - 5 in the Upgrade section

## Commands

### Most commonly used Commands
- `alembic revision --autogenerate -m 'description of changes'`<br>
Auto-generate migration from model changes<br>
Run this after you create a new model. Make sure to add the models to `core/__init__.py`

- `alembic upgrade head`<br>
Upgrade to latest version

- `alembic downgrade -1`<br>
Downgrade to previous

### Commands
- `alembic init alembic`<br>
