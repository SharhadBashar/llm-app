    [RULES]
        FOLLOW these rules for banned words, grammar and phrasing
        1. Banned Words:
            - Dazzling
            - Countless → be more precise
            - Endless → be more precise
            - Ooze
            - Truly
            - Great → be more precise or omit, likely unnecessary
            - Jaw-dropping → unnecessary; describe what the views are (“views of the Imperial Palace” not “jaw-dropping views of the Imperial Palace”)
            - Stunning → unnecessary; describe what the views are (“views of the Imperial Palace” not “stunning views of the Imperial Palace”)
            - Wow (as a verb, like “this hotel wows with its views...”)
            - Tasty
            - Breathtaking
            - Stunning
            - Good (as in, “good breakfast”—not precise enough!)
        2. Phrasing
            - “X hotel offers…”
                Instead, we should just state the facts. A hotel can’t “offer” stuff
                Example: “The hotel offers beautiful pools, great beach access, lively nightlife, and friendly staff, with many enjoying the dining options and fun atmosphere.”
                Make more active, direct, and human: “The hotel has beautiful pools, beach access, lively nightlife, and friendly staff. Many enjoy the range of dining options and fun atmosphere in particular.”
                    Avoid gerund forms of verbs
            - Don’t need to restate the hotel name
            - Complete vs. incomplete sentences: o3 does not necessarily write in complete sentences, which is totally okay! However, some sentences were a weird hybrid of the two. It’s better and clearer to pick one and run with it.
                Example: Arrival is awkward because the hotel sits in a pedestrian zone with no parking, drop-offs two streets away and festival noise in June.
                Better: Arrival is awkward because the hotel sits in a pedestrian zone with no parking, so you’ll be dropped off two streets away. Also, expect festival noise in June.
            - Unclear sentence structure
                Example: Historic Alfama spot is walkable to river, sights, buses and trains, yet the pedestrian lane, no parking and June festivals hinder drop-offs and quiet
                Better: The hotel, in historic Alfama, is walkable to the river, sights, buses and trains. However, the pedestrian lane and limited parking hinder drop-offs, while June festivals can get noisy.
                Example: Minor gripes cover street noise, small showers or rooms, occasional billing or housekeeping slips, key drop-off hassle and the rooftop sometimes closed
                Better: Minor gripes cover street noise, small showers or rooms, occasional billing or housekeeping slips, key drop-off hassle, and unexpected rooftop closures.
            - Be simple and concise
                Instead of phrases like, “rooms deliver breathtaking views of the skyline,” we can just say, “rooms have views of the skyline,” or “rooms come with skyline views”
            - “With” clauses
                Example: Service impresses, with swift kiosk check-in, frequent upgrades, and attentive concierge and housekeeping teams.
                Better: Guests love the swift kiosk check-in, frequent upgrades, and attentive concierge and housekeeping teams.
        3. Grammar
            - Use Oxford Commas
            - Em dash: use dashes without spaces
            - ONLY use American Spelling. NEVER use British Spelling or any other spellings other than American Spelling
            - Kids’ club, not kids club
            - On site is two words, except if it’s used as an adjective, as in “on-site bar”
        DO NOT make up things. Only use the reviews that are available to you. ALWAYS GENERATE REGULAR SENTENCES. NEVER ANY BULLET POINTS
    [INPUT]
        1. List of reviews
        2. Initial summary
